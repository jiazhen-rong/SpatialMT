\title{Calculate Differentially Expressed Genes Between Two Groups of Cells}
\usage{
calculate_DEGs_from_cell_barcodes(
  seu,
  lineage1_cells,
  lineage2_cells,
  assay = "RNA",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{seu}{A Seurat object containing gene expression data.}

\item{lineage1_cells}{A character vector of cell barcodes belonging to the first group.}

\item{lineage2_cells}{A character vector of cell barcodes belonging to the second group.}

\item{assay}{A character string specifying which assay to use for DE analysis (default "RNA").}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{FindMarkers()} (e.g., test.use, logfc.threshold, etc.).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the differentially expressed genes between the two groups.
}
\description{
This function performs differential expression analysis between two groups of cells,
defined by their cell barcodes. It creates a temporary metadata column in the Seurat object
to assign cells to either "Lineage1" or "Lineage2" based on the provided barcode lists,
subsets the object to only include those cells, and then runs Seurat's \code{FindMarkers()}
to identify differentially expressed genes.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Suppose you have two sets of cell barcodes from your AF.dm/N analysis:
  degs <- calculate_DEGs_from_cell_barcodes(seu, 
            lineage1_cells = c("Cell1", "Cell2", "Cell3"),
            lineage2_cells = c("Cell10", "Cell11", "Cell12"),
            assay = "RNA",
            test.use = "wilcox", logfc.threshold = 0.25)
  head(degs)
}
