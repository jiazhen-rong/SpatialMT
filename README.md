# SUMMIT Overview
This GitHub contains the beta version of the Spatial Mitochondrial Variant Test - **SUMMIT** package.

All the analysis codes are within the [Analysis](https://github.com/jiazhen-rong/SpatialMT/tree/main/Analysis) folder. 

All the results in our paper was based on SUMMIT v1.0.0. 

For Single-cell enriched mitochondrial variant related test and filtering, please view our previous package [scmtVT](https://github.com/jiazhen-rong/scmtVT).
